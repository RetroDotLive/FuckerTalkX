What is FtalkX?
It's a play on a catapult inside joke, smashed together with Appletalk. It's also a functioning Xband Server with some pretty good debugging capabilities

What can I do with it?
Have your own functioning server for the Xband Modem to play around with!

Troubleshooting :
Q : It crashes on open!
A : You don't have any serial devices / modems attached
